          "neurolend Finance is a peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency lending platform built on Somnia L1. It allows users to lend their crypto assets to earn interest or borrow crypto by providing collateral, all through secure smart contracts.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I get started with neurolend?",
        answer:
          "To get started, simply connect your Web3 wallet (like MetaMask) to our platform. Once connected, you can browse loan offers to borrow crypto or create your own loan offers to start lending and earning interest.",
      },
      {
        question: "What wallets are supported?",
        answer:
          "neurolend supports all major Web3 wallets including MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, and any wallet compatible with WalletConnect protocol.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need to create an account?",
        answer:
          "No, you don't need to create a traditional account. neurolend is fully decentralized - you just need to connect your Web3 wallet to start using the platform.",

    questions: [
      {
        question: "How much interest can I earn by lending?",
        answer:
          "Interest rates on neurolend are market-driven and can vary based on supply and demand. Lenders typically earn between 5-15% APY, depending on the loan terms, duration, and market conditions.",
      },
      {
        question: "What tokens can I lend?",
        answer:
          "neurolend supports a variety of popular cryptocurrencies including stablecoins (USDC, USDT), major tokens (WETH, WBTC), and other selected ERC-20 tokens. The supported token list is regularly updated based on market demand and security assessments.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I create a loan offer?",
        answer:
          "To create a loan offer, go to the 'Create' page, specify your loan terms (amount, interest rate, duration), choose accepted collateral types, and submit your offer. Your offer will appear in the marketplace for borrowers to accept.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I cancel my loan offer?",
        answer:
          "Yes, you can cancel your loan offer anytime before it's accepted by a borrower. Once a borrower accepts your offer and provides collateral, the loan becomes active and cannot be cancelled.",

    questions: [
      {
        question: "How do crypto loans work on neurolend?",
        answer:
          "Crypto loans on neurolend are collateralized, meaning you must deposit crypto assets as collateral to secure your loan. The collateral value must exceed the loan value by a certain ratio to protect lenders.",
      },
      {
        question: "What can I use as collateral?",
        answer:
          "You can use various cryptocurrencies as collateral, including WETH, WBTC, and other approved tokens. The platform uses real-time oracle pricing to determine fair collateral values.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if I can't repay my loan?",
        answer:
          "If you fail to repay your loan by the deadline, your collateral will be liquidated to repay the lender. The liquidation process is automated and handled by smart contracts to ensure fairness.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I repay my loan early?",
        answer:
          "Yes, you can repay your loan at any time before the deadline. Early repayment will save you interest costs, and you'll immediately regain access to your collateral.",

    questions: [
      {
        question: "How secure is neurolend Finance?",
        answer:
          "neurolend prioritizes security with multi-signature wallets, audited smart contracts, and institutional-grade security protocols. All funds are secured by smart contracts, and we never have custody of your assets.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are smart contracts audited?",
        answer:
          "Yes, all neurolend smart contracts undergo rigorous security audits by reputable firms. We also implement additional security measures like time-locks and multi-signature requirements for critical functions.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if there's a smart contract bug?",
        answer:
          "While our contracts are thoroughly audited, we maintain insurance funds and emergency procedures to protect users in the unlikely event of a critical bug. We also have a bug bounty program to incentivize security researchers.",
      },
      {
        question: "How are prices determined for liquidations?",
        answer:
          "neurolend uses Chainlink price oracles to get real-time, accurate market prices for all supported tokens. This ensures fair and transparent pricing for collateral valuations and liquidations.",

    questions: [
      {
        question: "What fees does neurolend charge?",
        answer:
          "neurolend charges a small platform fee (typically 0.5-1%) on successful loans to maintain and improve the platform. All fees are clearly displayed before you confirm any transaction.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are there any hidden fees?",
        answer:
          "No, neurolend believes in complete transparency. All fees, including platform fees and network gas costs, are clearly displayed before you confirm any transaction.",
      },
      {
        question: "How much are gas fees?",
        answer:
          "Gas fees depend on network congestion and are paid to the blockchain network, not neurolend. Built on Somnia L1, our platform offers significantly lower gas fees compared to Ethereum mainnet.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I pay fees for cancelled offers?",
        answer:
          "You only pay the network gas fee for creating an offer. If you cancel an offer that hasn't been accepted, you won't pay any platform fees - only the gas cost for the cancellation transaction.",

    questions: [
      {
        question: "My transaction is stuck or pending. What should I do?",
        answer:
          "If your transaction is pending for a long time, it might be due to network congestion or low gas fees. You can try speeding up the transaction in your wallet or wait for network conditions to improve.",
      },
      {
        question: "I can't see my loan or transaction. Where is it?",
